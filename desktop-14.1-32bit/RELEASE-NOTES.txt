Evolution of the project
------------------------

Over the last two years, the MLED project has undergone quite a few respins
based on various desktop environments like KDE, Xfce and MATE, as well as
various base distributions like Debian, Ubuntu LTS and CentOS. While these
successive versions were not bad technically speaking, I had to make a decision
based on a series of factors like perennity, popularity, flexibility, lack of
manpower, etc. 

Slackware meets most of my needs and seems to be the most flexible distribution
around. I opted for one single desktop environment, namely Xfce, and decided to
concentrate on quality rather than quantity. 

Ironically, this is also a move back to the roots. The very first avatar of
this project, dating back to 2006, was called "Slick Linux" at the time and was
based on Slackware 12.0 and Xfce 4.4. 

MLED is now here to stay and firmly based on Slackware Linux and the Xfce
desktop environment.
