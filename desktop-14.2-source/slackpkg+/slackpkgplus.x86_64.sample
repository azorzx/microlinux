# By default slackpkg+ deny to install 32bit packages.
#
# Set this flag to 'on' allow slackpkg+ to install 32bit packages on a 64bit slackware 
# installation (possibly unsafe). Please, do not install both 32 and 64bit of the same 
# package to avoid problems, and NEVER upgrade existant 64bit packages with relative 32bit package.
# Do not forget to install the multilibs.
ALLOW32BIT=off

# Enable (1) / Disable (0) the official slackpkg blacklist. May be useful to temporarily skip
# the slackware blacklist. You can also override it from command line:
# 'USEBL=0 slackpkg upgrade-all'
USEBL=1

# Add custom option to 'wget'.
# You can solve the repository indisponibility issue by set a timeout here

# Enable (on) / Disable (off) notification events (see notifymsg.conf)

# Enable (on) / Disable (off) the greylist feature. See /etc/slackpkg/greylist

# If two or more repositories contains some same packages, you can specify
# from which repository you prefer to search it.
# The syntax is "<repository_name>:<package_name>"
# Accepts regular expressions. To give priority to an entire repository use "<repository_name>"

# Examples:
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( restricted:vlc )
# OR
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( myrepo )
# 
# if you have two reporitories to give priority you must set both in the same line
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( myrepo restricted:vlc )
#
# if you want to install 'ktown' repository you must set it here
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( ktown )
# and read special instruction on /usr/doc/slackpkg+-*/repositories.txt
#
# If you want a multilib system, uncomment the multilib repository and set:
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( multilib )
#
# (Use /usr/doc/slackpkg+-*/setupmultilib.sh to setup a multilib configuration)
#
# For both multilib and ktown set
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( multilib ktown )

PKGS_PRIORITY=( multilib:.* microlinux-desktop:.* )

# Otherwise you can try to upgrade a package from a repository that contains a package with the
# same tag of the already installed package. Tipically that means to upgrade a package from the
# same author of the already installed package.
# Note that this method may not works properly where two repositories contains a package with the
# same tag.
# Set TAG_PRIORITY to 'on' to enable this function
TAG_PRIORITY=off

# List repositories you want to use (defined below)
# remember to launch 'slackpkg update' if you modify that row.
REPOPLUS=( multilib microlinux-desktop microlinux-extras )

# Define mirrors (uncomment one or more mirror; remember to add it to REPOPLUS)
