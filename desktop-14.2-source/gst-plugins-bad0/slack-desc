gst-plugins-bad0: gst-plugins-bad0 (a set of GStreamer plugins)
gst-plugins-bad0:
gst-plugins-bad0: GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to
gst-plugins-bad0: par compared to the rest. They might be close to being good 
gst-plugins-bad0: quality, but they're missing something - be it a good code 
gst-plugins-bad0: review, some documentation, a set of tests, a real live 
gst-plugins-bad0: maintainer, or some actual wide use.
