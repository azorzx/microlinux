About MLED
----------

The Microlinux Enterprise Desktop (MLED) is a full-blown production desktop
based on Slackware Linux and the Xfce desktop environment, with many
enhancements. It is currently used by various small town halls, public
libraries, schools and local radio stations in South France.

Check out the MLED project page for more information:

About this Installation Guide
-----------------------------

The following instructions assume you already know how to install and
configure Slackware Linux. Read them carefully. The bits you skip will come
back and bite you. 

If you are not familiar with Slackware, head over to the Slackware
Documentation project at http://docs.slackware.com and read the section
"Getting Started with Slackware".

MLED installs on top of a carefully selected Slackware base and doesn't ship
on its own installation ISO. All you need is a vanilla Slackware installation
disc and a working internet connection.

In order to avoid painstakingly picking each package or installing the whole
kitchen sink, the recommended method is to use the provided set of tagfiles.
These are plain text files supposed to automate the potentially tedious
package selection process, like a bone-headed version of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux' Kickstart files.


First things first
------------------

Boot the Slackware installation DVD (or the first CD). Select your keyboard
layout, login as root and partition your hard disk, but don't start the
installer yet.

Bring up your network interface, for example:

  root@slackware:/# dhcpcd eth0 


Grab the set of tagfiles
------------------------

The Slackware installation environment already sports an empty '/tag'
directory for a set of tagfiles, so let's use it.

  # cd /tag 

Grab the set of tagfiles from the server:

  # wget http://www.microlinux.fr/microlinux/desktop-14.1-64bit/tagfiles.tar.gz 

Unpack the downloaded archive:

  # tar xvzf tagfiles.tar.gz 

Your '/tag' directory should now contain a series of directories corresponding
to the Slackware package sets:

  # ls 
  a/ ap/ d/ e/ f/ k/ kde/ kdei/ l/ n/ t/ tcl/ x/ xap/ xfce/ y/


Start the installation
----------------------

Now start the Slackware installer:

  # setup 

PACKAGE SERIES SELECTION: accept the default package selection, since the
tagfiles will override this and take care of selecting each package anyway.

SELECT PROMPTING MODE: tagpath - Use tagfiles in the subdirectories of a
custom path

Path to tagfiles: /tag

USE UTF-8 TEXT CONSOLE: Yes

CONFIRM STARTUP SERVICES TO RUN: accept the default selection

SELECT DEFAULT WINDOW MANAGER FOR X: xinitrc.wmaker or xinitrc.fluxbox. This
choice is only temporary. I usually choose one of the more lightweight window
managers like WindowMaker or Fluxbox to configure X.

Finish the base Slackware installation. Eventually, chroot into the newly
installed environment, configure and build an initrd and replace the HUGE
kernel by the GENERIC kernel.

Exit and reboot. Don't define a user yet. We'll wait until the MLED user
profiles are installed.


Download the Microlinux scripts
-------------------------------

I'm providing a few helper scripts and ready-to-use configuration files to
speed up the installation process. Grab the whole Microlinux file tree using
the following command:

  # cd 
  # git clone https://github.com/kikinovak/microlinux 


Configure slackpkg
------------------

In its default configuration, the 'slackpkg' package manager only works with
the official Slackware repositories. We need to install and configure Matteo
Rossini's nifty 'slackpkg+' plugin to enable third-party repositories. To
avoid the hassle, Microlinux provides a custom 'slackpkg+' package that comes
preconfigured for the Microlinux repositories.

On the command line, use the Links browser to navigate through the
repositories:

  # links http://www.microlinux.fr/microlinux/ 

Navigate to the 'desktop-14.1-64bit/slackware64/' subdirectory. Grab the
'slackpkg+' package from the repository (use the [D] key in the Links browser
to download it) and install it:

  # installpkg slackpkg+-1.3.2-noarch-1_microlinux.txz  

Edit '/etc/slackpkg/mirrors' and choose a Slackware mirror according to your
geographical location, for example:

--8<---------- /etc/slackpkg/mirrors -----------------------------------------
...
# GERMANY (DE)
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/linux/slackware/slackware64-14.1/
...
--8<--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you choose only one single mirror for Slackware stable. If you're
using MLED in France, configure the ftp.fu-berlin.de or the mirror.switch.ch
mirror. The admins at OVH can't seem to get their act together.

Update GPG keys:

  # slackpkg update gpg 

Update information about available packages:

  # slackpkg update 


Trim the base installation
--------------------------

In case you didn't use the set of tagfiles during the initial installation,
now's the time to eventually catch up on it. 

The 'desktop-14.1-64bit/tools/' subdirectory provides a basic 'trim.sh' script
that takes care of two things:

  1. install needed packages

  2. get rid of unneeded packages

The script makes use of 'slackpkg', so make sure it's configured correctly.

Trim your Slackware installation: 

  # cd microlinux/desktop-14.1-64bit/tools/ 
  # ./trim.sh 

Two packages are provided by the official 'extra/' repository. Install them
manually:

  # slackpkg install mplayerplug-in recordmydesktop 


A word on what's left out
-------------------------

MLED doesn't rely on a full Slackware installation. Here's what's NOT
installed :

  1. Everything related to KDE, since MLED is based on Xfce.

  2. The xf86-video-nouveau driver, since the proprietary drivers work better.

  3. Various exotic fonts, which clutter LibreOffice's font preview.

  4. Some small X11 applications like Blueman, Gnuchess, etc.

Of course, you're free to override this selection by manually installing any
package (Nouveau driver, exotic font, Blueman, etc.) that's been left out with
a simple 'slackpkg install <package>'.


Upgrade the base installation
-----------------------------

Now upgrade the base Slackware packages:

  # slackpkg upgrade-all 

Two important remarks on this initial upgrade:

  1. You'll notice that some Slackware packages like the Xfce desktop,
  Audacious or MPlayer will be "upgraded", e. g. replaced by an MLED package.
  Don't worry, this is normal. MLED replaces Xfce 4.10 by the latest Xfce 4.12,
  and the audio and video players have been rebuilt for enhanced multimedia
  capabilities.

  2. Your 'gcc-*' and 'glibc-*' packages will be replaced by Multilib
  versions. Again, don't worry, this is also on purpose.


Multilib stuff
--------------

You may want to add applications like VirtualBox, Wine, Skype, etc. This is
why 'slackpkg+' has been preconfigured to make use of Eric Hameleers' Multilib
packages.

The initial system upgrade we've just performed has already replaced your base
'gcc-*' and 'glibc-*' packages by the respective Multilib versions. The only thing
that's left to do now is to install the complete set of additional 32-bit
support libraries. This can be done in one simple step using the following
command:

  # slackpkg install multilib 


Install the MLED package collection
-----------------------------------

Installing the full set of MLED packages is as simple as this:

  # slackpkg install microlinux-desktop


Set locales
-----------

Now you'll probably have to adjust your environment variables in
'/etc/profile.d/lang.sh'. Default variables are set to fr_FR.UTF8, since
MLED's main use is in France:

--8<---------- /etc/profile.d/lang.sh ----------------------------------------
...
export LANG=fr_FR.utf8
export LC_COLLATE=fr_FR.utf8
--8<--------------------------------------------------------------------------

English-speaking Slackware users will use something like this:

--8<---------- /etc/profile.d/lang.sh ----------------------------------------
...
export LANG=en_US.utf8
export LC_COLLATE=en_US.utf8
--8<--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Clean up the applications menu
------------------------------

The 'desktop-14.1-64bit/tools/' subdirectory features the 'cleanmenu.sh'
utility, a small Bash script to clean up various desktop menu entries and make
them Joe-Sixpack-friendly. Run this utility:

  # cd microlinux/desktop-14.1-64bit/tools/
  # ./cleanmenu.sh 

The script replaces many '*.desktop' files in '/usr/share/applications' and
similar locations by some custom-made menu entry files. For now, they're only
localized in english, french and german, so you may not want to run the script
if you use another language.


Finishing up
------------

We're almost there. Here's what's left to be done.

  * Configure the X.org server.

  * Define one or more normal users for the system.

  * Switch to default runlevel 4.

  * Reboot.


Extra applications
------------------

Once your MLED system is up and running, you can search and install extra
applications using 'slackpkg'.

Example :

  # slackpkg search microlinux-extras
  # slackpkg install virtualbox 


Maintenance
-----------

Here's a few tips & tricks to keep your MLED installation up-to-date.

Check out the various 'ChangeLog.txt' files at the root of each package
repository for new additions and/or updates.

If you want to know the state of your system, what's installed, what's not
installed, what updates are available, etc., you can do all this in a few
commands:

  # slackpkg search microlinux-desktop

Or:

  # slackpkg search microlinux-extras

Last but not least, application updates may sometimes overwrite the custom
menu entries with a default '*.desktop' file. If that is the case, simply
rerun the 'cleanmenu.sh' utility.


Enjoy your shiny new Microlinux Enterprise Desktop!
